Write the code for the server program that:
•	listens for the connection requests from the clients on port 8080
•	once the client requests a connection, opens a connection socket and input/output streams
•	reads a single line sent by the client through the socket and prints the clients request to the console.
•	Sends the length of the request back to the client.
•	Make sure to catch IOException in this method.
•	No need to write the client.
